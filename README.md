# esp32Collection

Collection of smol and not so small programs for the ESP32 board(s) written in C++.

Current challenge is to build&deploy, less focus on the functionality.
Using scrolling 8x8 LED-arrays does work (MAX7219).
Generating random numbers and reacting to "Boot" button press does work as well.
